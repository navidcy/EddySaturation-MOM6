# EddySaturation-MOM6

This repository contains setup and configuration files for Modular Ocean Model version 6 ([MOM6](http://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/MOM6)) for a zonally reeantrant Southern Ocean-like channel setup with varying number of fluid layers.

This configuration was used for the simulations in the paper:

Constantinou, N. C. and Hogg, A. McC. (2019). Eddy saturation of the Southern Ocean: a baroclinic versus barotropic perspective. (in review, arXiv:[1906.08442][arXiv:1906.08442])


### Repo contents:

`config-files`: a sample of the config files for a 2-fluid layer configuration.

`input-files`: a Jupyter notebook that produces the input files required by the MOM6 configuration and an example of such input files for a 2-layer channel configuration.
